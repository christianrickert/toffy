Sometimes FOV channel counts are too high, when the detector is stochastically adding counts (false positive = Type I error) due to very high detector gain values. Only valid counts from a detector running within its optimal detector gain range should be used for the creation of the calibration curve: You should therefore adjust the default maximum peak height (MPH) range below and run the code cell multiple times until your calibration curve looks like the example curve.** Two curves will be produced, one including all of the data and one excluding values outside of the maximum peak height range. \n",
